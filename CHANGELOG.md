## [Unreleased]
### Added

- **`vmaf_feature_backend_twin()` and `vmaf_registered_feature_extractor()`**
  in `libvmaf.h`. The first tells a caller which device twin model dispatch
  would use for a CPU extractor on the context's backend, and whether that twin
  can honour the given options and picture size. The second lists the
  registered extractors and the backend each one runs on. Both are additive;
  `vmaf_use_feature()` still selects by exact name. See
  [the C API reference](docs/api/index.md#device-twins-and-the-extractors-that-ran).
- **`feature_backends` in the CLI's JSON output**: one
  `{"extractor": ..., "backend": ...}` entry per registered extractor, next to
  `backend_used`, so a run that mixes device twins and CPU extractors says so.


### Changed

- **The SYCL integer ADM twin computes AIM on the device, so the default model's
  ADM no longer falls back to the CPU under `--backend sycl` (ADR-1362).**
  `adm_sycl` now emits `VMAF_integer_feature_aim_score` and
  `VMAF_integer_feature_adm3_score`, and every ADM output (adm2 and the four
  scales included) is now bit for bit equal to `--backend cpu` on
  8-bit and 10-bit input, odd and 17x17 frames, with the default and the
  default model's options. With the default model on an Arc B580, a 3840x2160
  frame drops from 48.4 to 9.2 ms at the default `--threads 0` and from 24.3 to
  9.7 ms at `--threads 16` (CPU backend with 16 threads: 27-32 ms). On a UHD 770
  the same run gets slower (4K: 75.7 to 87.5 ms, and 40.5 to 79.4 ms at
  `--threads 16`), because the iGPU now does the ADM work the CPU used to do
  beside it. The twin also accepts
  `adm_skip_aim`. Before, adm2 and the scales were up to 2.9e-7 from the CPU
  (double host finalisation) and, on 4K content, `integer_adm_scale2` up to
  1.40e-6 (a decouple ratio that wrapped at scales 1-3).
  See [SYCL backend](docs/backends/sycl/overview.md).


- `cambi_sycl` now runs every stage on the GPU — preprocessing, the spatial
  mask, the per-scale decimation and mode filter, the sliding-histogram
  c-values and the top-K pooling — and reads back one 88-byte block per
  frame instead of downloading the image and mask and computing the c-values
  on the host at every scale (ADR-1357). It reads the distorted plane from
  the shared SYCL frame upload and rides the combined command graph with the
  other SYCL extractors. At 3840x2160 (Big Buck Bunny, `--feature cambi_sycl`,
  ms/frame from `t(22) - t(2)`) the Arc B580 goes from 140 to 9.3 and the
  UHD 770 from 944 to 42; the default model on the UHD 770 goes from 976 to
  103 at 4K and from 138 to 20 at 576x324. Scores are bit-identical to `--backend cpu` whenever the CPU's
  own top-K double sum is exact (every 576x324 and 1080p fixture tested, 47
  of 50 Big Buck Bunny 4K frames); on the other frames the device returns the
  exactly rounded pooled mean and the CPU differs by its summation rounding
  (at most 2.2e-15 on Big Buck Bunny). `cambi.c` exports its reciprocal table
  as `vmaf_cambi_reciprocal_lut()` for GPU twins. The CUDA, HIP and Metal
  twins keep the host residual (RC3 rows in `docs/state.md`).


- **`ciede_sycl` is about twice as fast at 4K on Intel Arc.** The SYCL
  ciede2000 extractor no longer upscales U and V to luma resolution on the host
  before every frame. It uploads the planes at their native size and the kernel
  reads chroma at the subsampled position, as the CUDA and HIP extractors do.
  Measured at 3840x2160 8-bit 4:2:0, `--feature ciede_sycl` drops from 17.2 to
  8.4 ms per frame on an Arc B580 and from 52.9 to 46.0 ms on a UHD 770. Scores
  are unchanged, bit for bit.
- The CLI guide corrects the `--threads` default, which is serial (`0`), not
  the host's core count.


- **`float_ssim` runs on SYCL at 1080p and 4K (ADR-1370).** The SYCL twin
  implemented only scale 1, so `--backend sycl --feature float_ssim` and every
  model on a picture with a short side of 384 px or more computed the feature
  on the CPU and printed `float_ssim_sycl cannot run 3840x2160 8-bit pictures
  with these options`. `float_ssim_sycl` now applies `float_ssim`'s automatic
  (or explicit, `scale=2..10`) decimation on the device, with planes identical
  to the CPU's bit for bit, and uploads raw samples instead of converting both
  planes to fp32 on the host. At 3840x2160 8-bit on an Arc B580 it takes 6.7 ms
  per frame, against 11.0 ms for the CPU extractor on 16 threads and 29.3 ms
  for the old fallback at the default thread count; scale 1 at 4K drops from
  10.6 to 7.8 ms. `enable_lcs`, `enable_db` and `clip_db` work at every scale.
  Only a plane that decimates below 11x11 still falls back. See
  [the SYCL backend guide](docs/backends/sycl/overview.md#float_ssim-decimation-on-the-device-2026-09-29).


- **SYCL `psnr_hvs`, `psnr` and `motion_v2` read the frame the device already
  holds (ADR-1369).** A SYCL run uploads each plane of a frame once, and these
  twins now read it there: `psnr_hvs_sycl` no longer converts all three planes
  to float on the host and uploads them a second time, `motion_v2_sycl` no
  longer re-uploads the reference luma, and chroma goes up once per frame for
  every twin that reads it, from a pinned staging buffer. The psnr_hvs kernel
  runs two work-items per 8x8 block in one dispatch for all planes, and psnr
  adds one atomic per work-group instead of one per pixel. At 3840x2160,
  `psnr_hvs` drops from 17.1 to 7.6 ms per frame on an Arc B580 (16 CPU
  threads: 6.6) and from 124 to 60 on a UHD 770, where `psnr` drops from 25.3
  to 12.3; `motion_v2` loses about 1.6 ms of host copy and upload per frame.
  Every score is bit-identical to the previous twins. On the zero-copy VA import path, which imports luma only,
  `psnr_sycl` and `psnr_hvs_sycl` with chroma now fail the frame with an error
  instead of crashing. See
  [the SYCL backend guide](docs/backends/sycl/overview.md#psnr-psnr_hvs-and-motion_v2-share-the-uploaded-frame-adr-1369-2026-09-29).


- **The SYCL SpEED twins run entirely on the device and match the CPU bit for
  bit (ADR-1358).** `speed_chroma_sycl` and `speed_temporal_sycl` no longer
  filter, factorise the 25x25 covariance or wait on the queue on the host
  between device passes: each frame is one upload, one replayed SYCL graph and
  one result read. On an Arc B580, `speed_chroma` at 3840x2160 drops from 23.3
  to 7.5 ms per frame and `speed_temporal` from 60.4 to 7.6 (CPU with 16
  threads: 7.2 and 37.3); at 576x324 both run in under a millisecond. Every
  per-frame `speed_chroma_u/v/uv` and `speed_temporal` score now equals
  `--backend cpu` exactly, where previously most frames differed by up to
  4.2e-5. Request the twins by name (`--feature speed_chroma_sycl`):
  `--feature speed_chroma --backend sycl` runs the CPU extractor.
  `scripts/dev/speed_gpu_parity.py` checks and times any GPU twin against the
  CPU. See [SpEED](docs/metrics/speed_qa.md).


- **Cross-backend gate: the `psnr_hvs` tolerance grows with the frame size.**
  The CPU `psnr_hvs` adds every coefficient error of a plane into one `float`,
  so its rounding error grows with the number of 8x8 blocks, and a correct GPU
  twin landed 8.4e-4 dB away at 3840x2160 against a fixed 5e-4 tolerance.
  `cross_backend_parity_gate.py` and `cross_backend_vif_diff.py` now multiply
  the `psnr_hvs` tolerance by √(N / N₅₇₆ₓ₃₂₄) above 576x324 (3.34e-3 at 4K);
  576x324 and smaller frames keep 5e-4. Both gates also stop crashing when a
  score is non-finite on both backends (JSON `null`, for example `psnr_hvs_cb`
  on identical chroma) (ADR-1361).


- The oneAPI container image is published as `ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx:<tag>-oneapi2026`,
  named for the oneAPI release it now carries. The same image is also tagged
  `<tag>-oneapi2025`, so existing scripts keep working, and the Dockerfile
  stage `final-oneapi2025` still builds it. Prefer `-oneapi2026` and
  `final-oneapi2026` in new scripts (ADR-1368).


- **Four SYCL twins take the CPU extractor's options and match it
  (ADR-1365).** `psnr_sycl` now accepts `enable_mse`, `enable_apsnr`,
  `reduced_hbd_peak` and `min_sse` and matches `--backend cpu` bit for bit,
  `apsnr_*` aggregates included; the PSNR option math now lives in
  `core/src/feature/psnr_score.h`, shared by the CPU extractor and the twin.
  `integer_ssim_sycl` accepts `enable_db` / `clip_db`, `float_ssim_sycl`
  `enable_lcs` / `enable_db` / `clip_db` (`float_ssim_l/c/s` within 8.3e-7 of
  the CPU), and `float_motion_sycl` `motion_max_val`. Before, a model or a
  `--backend sycl --feature psnr=enable_mse=true`-style request that set one of
  these options computed the feature on the CPU, and naming the twin with the
  option failed with `unknown option`. Both SSIM twins now score an
  identical window exactly 1, so with `enable_db` identical frames report the
  CPU's `+inf` or `clip_db` ceiling; their default linear scores moved by at
  most 1.1e-8. Measured on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770; see
  [the SYCL backend guide](docs/backends/sycl/overview.md#cpu-options-on-the-psnr-ssim-and-float-motion-twins-2026-09-29).


### Fixed

- **`--feature <name>` now runs on the GPU that `--backend` names.**
  `vmaf --backend sycl --feature ciede` used to initialise the SYCL device and
  compute `ciede2000` with the CPU extractor, one frame at a time, while the
  JSON reported `"backend_used": "sycl"`. With an explicit `--backend cuda`,
  `sycl`, `hip` or `metal`, a CPU extractor name now runs on that backend's
  twin (`ciede_sycl` here), chosen the way a model's features are
  ([ADR-1359](docs/adr/1359-cli-feature-backend-twin.md)). When the backend has
  no twin, or the twin cannot honour an option or the input size, the CPU
  extractor runs and one `vmaf: warning: --feature <name>: ...` line says why.
  Twin names such as `--feature ciede_sycl`, `--backend cpu`, `--backend auto`
  and runs without `--backend` behave as before.
- **`backend_used` reports the backend that computed the features.** It used to
  name the backend that was initialised, even when nothing ran on it. It now
  names the device when at least one extractor ran there and `cpu` otherwise;
  the new `feature_backends` array says where each extractor ran.


- The oneAPI container image no longer crashes on Arc B580 (Battlemage)
  GPUs. Through v1.0.0-rc.2 it shipped the Intel GPU compute runtime of
  Intel's `oneapi-runtime:2025.3.1` image (version 25.18), and every
  `vmaf --backend sycl` run on a B580 ended with a segmentation fault (exit
  code 139) right after device selection. Arc A380 and UHD 770 GPUs were not
  affected. Replacing only that runtime with compute-runtime 26.35 stopped the
  crash; replacing only the Level Zero loader did not. The image now builds and
  runs on Debian 13, like the CPU image, with Intel's oneAPI 2026.1 compiler
  and SYCL runtime from Intel's apt repository at one exact build, and with the
  compute runtime (26.35.39758.10) and Level Zero loader (1.34.0) that the
  development container uses, all pinned in `build-config.env` (ADR-1368).


- Release provenance for the native Linux files and the `vmaf-mcp` wheel and
  sdist is a GitHub build-provenance attestation (SLSA v1 provenance
  predicate, signed through Sigstore) instead of `slsa-github-generator`
  output. The generator calls its own actions by tag, which the organisation's
  SHA-pinning policy rejects, so the v1.0.0-rc.2 publication failed until the
  policy was relaxed by hand. Releases now attach
  `vmafx-build-provenance.sigstore.json` and `vmaf-mcp-provenance.sigstore.json`
  in place of the `.intoto.jsonl` files; verify with
  `gh attestation verify FILE --repo VMAFx/vmafx`, or offline with `--bundle`
  (ADR-1356). PyPI's PEP 740 attestations are unchanged.


- SYCL builds now contain the native Intel GPU code that `sycl_icpx_aot_targets`
  asks for. Since ADR-0568 the images were compiled into the objects and then
  dropped at the link, so every `libvmaf.so` was SPIR-V only and compiled its
  kernels on each cold start: the default model's first frame took 524 ms on an
  Arc B580 with a cold compiler cache and now takes 201 ms (UHD 770: 609 to
  245 ms); scores are bit-identical. SYCL sources are compiled with
  `-fno-sycl-rdc --offload-compress`, so the images are built at compile time
  and survive every link; `libvmaf.so` grows from 4.6 to 7.7 MB. An AOT build
  now needs Intel's `ocloc` on `PATH` (`scripts/ci/install-intel-ocloc.sh`
  installs the release pinned as `INTEL_NEO_VERSION` in `build-config.env`),
  and configure stops with an explanation without it; configure with
  `-Dsycl_icpx_aot_targets=` for a SPIR-V-only build. On Linux the build fails
  if `libvmaf.so` lacks an image for any requested target (ADR-1360).


- **SYCL: `psnr_hvs_sycl` no longer crashes on Intel Arc B580 (Xe2).** The Intel
  GPU compiler (IGC 2.41.5) crashed the host process with SIGSEGV while
  compiling the kernel at SIMD32 for Xe2, triggered by the 8x8 DCT running in
  one work-item's private memory. The DCT now runs in local memory, split
  across work-items. Scores are bit-identical on devices where the old kernel
  ran, and a 4K frame takes 130 ms instead of 208 ms on a UHD 770
  (`T-SYCL-PSNR-HVS-B580-SIGSEGV-2026-09-29`).
- **SYCL: small frames no longer lose the device.** `adm_sycl`, `vif_sycl`,
  `motion_sycl`, `motion_v2_sycl`, `float_motion_sycl` and `float_vif_sycl`
  loaded their local-memory tiles, padding lanes included, with a single edge
  reflection. On small planes that read outside the buffer and raised
  `UR_RESULT_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770: `adm_sycl` for
  frames 64 rows high or less, `vif_sycl` up to at least 96x64 and
  `motion_sycl` up to 33x33 on the B580. The loads now stay inside the plane;
  scores for larger frames are unchanged
  (`T-SYCL-TILE-HALO-OOB-READ-2026-09-29`).
- **SYCL: `vif_sycl` hands frames below 16 pixels to the CPU.** Its filters
  reach more than one reflection outside planes smaller than 16 pixels in
  either dimension, which lost the device at 8x8. Model dispatch now computes
  such frames with the CPU `vif` extractor, bit-identical to a CPU run; a
  direct `--feature vif_sycl` request fails with an error naming `vif`
  (`T-INTEGER-VIF-TINY-FRAME-GUARD-2026-09-29`).
- **SYCL: `vif_sycl` scores are correct for odd widths.** When the width at
  any scale was odd (for example 854x480, 1366x768 or 853x480), scales 1-3 read
  the downsampled plane at the wrong row stride and drifted from the CPU by up
  to 1.2e-3 at those sizes and 3.3e-2 on tiny frames, which also moved the
  VMAF score. They now match the CPU within 1e-6 at those sizes
  (`T-SYCL-VIF-ODD-WIDTH-RD-STRIDE-2026-09-29`).
- **SYCL: a device fault now fails the frame.** After a failed graph wait the
  `adm_sycl`, `vif_sycl`, `motion_sycl`, `psnr_sycl` and `float_moment_sycl`
  extractors emitted scores for that frame from stale buffers (about 1.0 for
  every ADM scale) and `vmaf_read_pictures()` returned 0; only a later frame's
  upload failed. They now return `-EIO` for the faulted frame
  (`T-SYCL-GRAPH-WAIT-ERROR-DROPPED-2026-09-29`).


- **`float_motion_sycl` honours `motion_force_zero` and weights its debug
  score.** The twin declared `motion_force_zero` but ignored it and emitted
  real motion scores; it now emits zeros, like the CPU `float_motion`. Its
  debug `VMAF_feature_motion_score` now carries `motion_fps_weight`, as on the
  CPU, instead of the unweighted SAD. The SSIM page no longer documents an
  `enable_chroma` option and `_cb` / `_cr` outputs that the `ssim` extractor
  does not have; it lists `enable_db` and `clip_db`
  ([SSIM](docs/metrics/ssim.md#options)).


- **`float_ssim_sycl` with `enable_db` no longer reports tens of dB below the
  CPU on near-identical frames.** The CPU rounds each frame's SSIM mean to fp32
  before converting it to dB, so a frame within half an fp32 step of 1 scores
  exactly 1 and reports `+inf` or the `clip_db` ceiling; the twin kept the
  double mean and reported a finite value (93.6 dB against the CPU's 121 dB on
  the first frames of a 4K pair). The twin now rounds the `float_ssim` and
  `float_ssim_l/c/s` means the same way; linear scores move by less than 6e-8.


- **`motion_sycl` matches the CPU `motion` exactly.** The SYCL twin blurred
  each frame and differenced the blurred frames, while the CPU (since the
  upstream pipelined-motion port) blurs the frame difference and rounds after
  each filter pass. The two orders round differently, so `motion2` was up to
  2.0e-4 off on 17x17 frames, 1.3e-5 on the Netflix 576x324 pair and 5.6e-6
  at 4K. `motion_sycl` and `motion_v2_sycl` now run one kernel with the CPU's
  arithmetic and agree with the CPU bit for bit at every size and bit depth
  tested, on an Arc B580 and a UHD 770 (ADR-1371). The 4K motion step costs
  about 11% more device time on both GPUs. With `motion_add_uv=true`,
  `motion_sycl` no longer waits on the device inside `submit()`: the U and V
  planes are staged in pinned memory and uploaded on the compute queue, which
  cuts host time per 4K frame from 5.4 to 0.6 ms on a UHD 770
  ([SYCL backend](docs/backends/sycl/overview.md#motion_sycl-matches-the-cpu-motion-exactly-2026-09-29)).


- **SYCL: `psnr_hvs_sycl` scores 9- and 11-bit input like the CPU.** The twin
  multiplied 9- and 11-bit samples by 16 before scoring them, so through the C
  API a 9-bit clip that the CPU scored at 22.47 dB came out at -1.57 dB
  (11 bits: 33.97 against 10.43). It now reads the raw sample at every bit
  depth, as `psnr_hvs` does; 8-, 10- and 12-bit scores are unchanged. The CLI
  accepts only 8, 10, 12 and 16 bits (`T-SYCL-PSNR-HVS-ODD-BPC-SCALE-2026-09-29`).


- **SYCL: the native Windows build runs its kernels.** A Windows MSVC build
  linked `vmaf.exe` and the tests with `link.exe`, which ignored `-fsycl` and
  never registered the SYCL device images, so every SYCL kernel submit failed
  with `No kernel named ... was found` and 47 of the 50 SYCL tests failed on an
  Arc B580. The build now runs one `icpx -fsycl -fsycl-link` step over the SYCL
  objects and links its registration object into every program that uses the
  SYCL backend, including static consumers of `vmaf.lib`. On an Arc B580 and a
  UHD 770 all SYCL tests pass and all 19 SYCL extractors agree with the CPU
  within the parity gate. The `Windows MSVC+SYCL` CI leg now checks that the
  kernels are registered, and [SYCL on Windows](docs/backends/sycl/windows.md)
  documents the native build (ADR-1364, `T-SYCL-WINDOWS-MSVC-KERNELS-UNREGISTERED-2026-09-29`).
- **CI: Windows test lanes gate their tests again.** `scripts/ci/run_meson_test.py`
  replaced itself with `meson test` through `os.execvp`, which on Windows starts
  Meson and ends the runner with status 0 at once. The Windows MinGW64 and ARM64
  MSVC lanes reported success after 17 to 19 tests, over failing ones. The runner
  now waits for Meson on Windows and returns its status; four Windows test-harness
  failures it had hidden are fixed (`T-CI-WINDOWS-MESON-TEST-RUNNER-EXIT-0-2026-09-29`,
  `T-TEST-WINDOWS-HARNESS-MASKED-FAILURES-2026-09-29`).
- **Parity gate: the `cambi` cell compares scores.** `cross_backend_parity_gate.py`
  and `cross_backend_vif_diff.py` looked the score up as `Cambi_feature_cambi_score`,
  but `vmaf --json` writes it as `cambi`, so the cell stopped with `KeyError`
  (`T-CI-PARITY-GATE-CAMBI-KEY-2026-09-29`).

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-09-28
### Changed

- The native Linux release bundle (`vmaf` and `libvmaf.so*`) now runs on
  Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13 and newer distributions: it needs glibc 2.38 and the
  libstdc++ of GCC 12 instead of glibc 2.43. It is compiled on the fork's
  Debian 13 release track, the base of the published container images, and
  each release checks it on Ubuntu 24.04 and in the distroless `cc-debian13`
  runtime image. Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 12 remain unsupported (ADR-1354).


- **The first-release candidate plan moved back by one candidate.**
  `v1.0.0-rc.2` is a stabilisation candidate: it ships the dependency updates
  and fixes merged since rc.1, and testers use the same report kit
  (`tools/rc1-tester/`) and exit bar as for rc.1. Benchmarking, profiling and
  tuning move to `v1.0.0-rc.3`, and the one-shot model retrain moves to
  `v1.0.0-rc.4`, so each phase number now matches its tag. The release guide,
  roadmap, tester guide, retrain runbook and `vmaf-rc1-report list-tools`
  inventory show the new mapping (ADR-1352).


### Fixed

- `--model` and `--feature` values keep their backslashes, so Windows paths work
  as typed: `path=..\..\models\m.json`, `path=\\server\share\m.json` and
  `path=C:\models\.cache\m.json` used to lose a backslash each (`\.` and `\\`
  were escapes in values too). `\:` and `\=` still escape a delimiter, and a
  backslash run directly before `:` or `=`, or at the end of a value, is read in
  pairs so a backslash in front of a delimiter stays writable. Keys and
  overload names keep the full escape set (ADR-1355). If you wrote a UNC path
  as `\\\\server\share` per the earlier advice, write `\\server\share` now.


- Container publication finishes for the large images. The GPU image jobs free
  runner disk before `syft` scans the pushed image (the 1.0.0-rc.1 ROCm SBOM
  failed with "no space left on device" after the image was pushed and
  signed), and the two-platform `vmafx-operator` build gets 60 minutes instead
  of 30. The CPU, MCP server, node and controller images no longer compile
  libvmaf's unit-test suite, which they never shipped: the arm64 builds were
  cancelled at 60 minutes while still linking tests under emulation.


- **Nightly Kubernetes E2E scores again** — the kind + kuttl scoring smoke sent
  a 64x64 clip to `/v1/score`. Since `vmaf_v1.0.16_3d0h` became the default
  model (ADR-1169), libvmaf refuses input that small (`cambi` needs one side of
  at least 216 pixels, `speed_chroma` needs 4:2:0 luma of at least 160x160), so
  the server answered HTTP 500 and every scheduled E2E run from 2026-09-24 on
  failed. The fixtures are now 216x160, the smallest size the default model
  accepts, and the test ConfigMap is created with server-side apply because the
  larger pair exceeds the 256 KiB annotation that client-side apply writes. The
  always-on E2E contract test now checks the fixture size against the
  thresholds in `core/src/feature/` on every pull request. On failure the score
  script now prints the `/v1/score` error body and the server Pods' logs; it
  previously discarded the body and, through `deployment/vmafx`, printed the
  operator's logs instead.


- The FFmpeg patched by `ffmpeg-patches/0019` builds without warnings on
  aarch64. GCC 14.2 flagged two `-Wstringop-overflow` false positives in
  `libavcodec/a64multienc.c`, which the node image's warning gate rejects, so
  the arm64 `vmafx-node` image could not build. The index tables are now
  filled per palette interval, with identical results. An image recovery run
  also takes `ffmpeg-patches/` from the dispatching commit (ADR-1350).


- **ffmpeg calls work with FFmpeg 9 again**: FFmpeg 9 removed the `-vsync`
  option, so the Python harness's decode step and the `describe_worst_frames`
  MCP tool (Python and Go servers) failed with "Unrecognized option 'vsync'"
  on the FFmpeg release this project pins. They now pass
  `-fps_mode passthrough`, the same mode as the old `-vsync 0`, which makes
  FFmpeg 5.1 the oldest release they work with. The harness change ports
  Netflix/vmaf `aeaf2877d`.


- The `vmafx-operator` and `vmafx-server` release images build each
  architecture on its own native runner, like `vmafx-node` (ADR-1349). Their
  arm64 halves were emulated with QEMU and took 30 to 46 minutes of a 60-minute
  limit; each still publishes one signed, attested multi-arch image.


- **Helm: the server Deployment no longer selects the operator and node Pods.**
  The chart's server Deployment and StatefulSet selected only the release
  labels, so they also matched the operator, node and `helm test` Pods, and
  `kubectl logs deployment/vmafx` could print the operator's log. Both now
  also select `app.kubernetes.io/component: server` (ADR-1353). Scoring
  traffic was not affected: the Services already selected the server Pods
  only. **Upgrade note for v1.0.0-rc.1 installs:** a workload's selector
  cannot be changed in place, so `helm upgrade` fails with
  `spec.selector: ... field is immutable`. Delete the server workload first;
  `--cascade=orphan` keeps its Pods serving until the upgrade replaces them:
  `kubectl delete deployment,statefulset -n <namespace> --cascade=orphan -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release>,app.kubernetes.io/component=server`,
  then run `helm upgrade` as usual. Uninstalling and installing again also
  works. See "Upgrading from 1.0.0-rc.1" in
  `docs/development/k8s-deployment.md`.


- A published release's container images can be recovered after a build
  recipe fix (ADR-1347). A `workflow_dispatch` of the image publish workflows
  on the default branch builds the release tag's source with that commit's
  `docker/` recipe and labels each image with `io.vmafx.build-recipe`; the
  dispatch path also reads the prerelease flag from the release itself, so it
  works for release candidates.
  The release guide now covers the `release-publish` environment step a
  recovery run needs (the environment admits only `v*` tags, so `master` is
  allowed for the recovery and removed afterwards) and how to make a new GHCR
  package public, which the REST API cannot do.
  The post-push smoke tests verify each image's signature against the
  identity of the run that signed it; they required the tag identity, which a
  recovery run cannot produce, so the first v1.0.0-rc.1 recovery failed its
  CPU smoke test after pushing and signing the image. The release guide shows
  how to verify a recovered image (`@refs/heads/master` identity and its
  `io.vmafx.build-recipe` label).


- `test_meson_secret_env_sanitization` passes when Meson is installed with
  `pip install --user`, which `scripts/setup/ubuntu.sh` and the nightly
  ThreadSanitizer job both do. Its probes replaced `HOME` with a temporary
  directory, which also moved Python's per-user package directory, so every
  probe stopped at `No module named 'mesonbuild'` before Meson ran. The probes
  now keep `PYTHONUSERBASE` pointed at the real user base while `HOME` stays
  synthetic.


- The `vmafx-node` image bundles rclone at `/usr/local/bin/rclone` again, as the
  storage guide states. The node resolves `s3://`, `gs://`, `rclone://` and
  `remote:path` inputs by running rclone (ADR-0719), but `docker/Dockerfile.node`
  never installed it, so every remote input failed. The static binary comes
  from the official rclone image, pinned by digest in `build-config.env`, and
  the release smoke test now runs it.


- The `vmafx-node` release image builds again. Its arm64 half compiled FFmpeg,
  libvmaf and the node binary under QEMU emulation and never finished within
  the job's two-hour limit, so no node image was published for v1.0.0-rc.1.
  Each architecture now builds on its own native runner, and the release
  publishes one merged multi-arch image, signed, attested and with an SBOM
  (ADR-1349).


- Release candidates after `1.0.0-rc.1` are numbered `1.0.0-rc.2`,
  `1.0.0-rc.3`, and so on (ADR-1348). release-please used its default
  versioning, which turned the first fix after `1.0.0-rc.1` into a proposed
  `1.0.1-rc.1` (release PR #1575); it now uses `prerelease` versioning, and the
  final cut becomes `1.0.0` once `prerelease` is switched off. The release guide
  also no longer claims that every new GHCR package starts private: with the
  organization's public-package setting on, a package first pushed from this
  repository is created public.
- The container quick start works for release candidates: it names the
  release tag instead of `latest` (release candidates are never tagged
  `latest`) and passes `--pixel_format 420` instead of the rejected `yuv420p`.
  The image docs list the `-rocm10` variant and the exact signing identities
  for recovered images, and a recovered image's
  `org.opencontainers.image.revision` label names the tag's source commit
  rather than the recipe commit it was built with.
- The container images carry the built-in models again: the CPU, MCP-server,
  CUDA and oneAPI builders lacked `xxd`, so libvmaf silently embedded no model
  and scoring without `--model` failed. The oneAPI image now installs the
  Unified Memory Framework runtime its SYCL adapters need; without it the image
  found no SYCL device. The publish smoke tests now score with the default model
  and check the oneAPI adapters, and the GPU image docs give working device and
  group flags, forced-backend scoring examples and measured parity figures.


- The native Linux `vmaf` CLI attached to a release runs next to the
  downloaded `libvmaf.so*` files without `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The
  `v1.0.0-rc.1` CLI kept Meson's build-tree RUNPATH `$ORIGIN/../src`, so it
  found `libvmaf.so.3` only when `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointed at the download
  directory. The release build now sets the staged CLI's RUNPATH to exactly
  `$ORIGIN`, and the release gate runs the CLI without `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and
  rejects any other RUNPATH.


- libvmaf builds against libc++ 23 again. The vendored libsvm
  (`core/src/svm.cpp`) defined its own global `swap` template, and libc++ 23's
  `std::vector` internals now call `swap` unqualified, so both it and
  `std::swap` matched and the file failed with "call to 'swap' is ambiguous".
  libsvm now uses `std::swap`; scores are unchanged.


- **Whole-tree clang-tidy ratchet ignores generated build products**: `tidy-ratchet.py`
  now skips every translation unit, diagnostic and header under `--build-dir`, so a
  build directory inside the repository measures the same checked-in sources as one
  outside it. The nightly `Full clang-tidy scan` builds in `build/` and had been failing
  on the 18 `xxd`-generated model embeds (`build/src/*.json.c`,
  `build/src/brisque_live.model.c`, two `misc-use-internal-linkage` warnings each)
  that the cpu baseline no longer lists. `make tidy-ratchet` / `tidy-ratchet-write` with
  the default in-tree `core/build` no longer measure or record them either. The arm64
  baseline, recorded from an in-tree `build-arm64`, was re-measured on its own toolchain:
  764 to 615 warnings (36 generated-file warnings, 25 already-ignored Pelorus-mirror
  entries and 88 warnings cleaned since 2026-09-23; no count rose) (ADR-1142).
