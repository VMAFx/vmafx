- The oneAPI container image is published as `ghcr.io/vmafx/vmafx:<tag>-oneapi2026`,
  named for the oneAPI release it now carries. The same image is also tagged
  `<tag>-oneapi2025`, so existing scripts keep working, and the Dockerfile
  stage `final-oneapi2025` still builds it. Prefer `-oneapi2026` and
  `final-oneapi2026` in new scripts (ADR-1368).
