- **`float_ssim` runs on SYCL at 1080p and 4K (ADR-1370).** The SYCL twin
  implemented only scale 1, so `--backend sycl --feature float_ssim` and every
  model on a picture with a short side of 384 px or more computed the feature
  on the CPU and printed `float_ssim_sycl cannot run 3840x2160 8-bit pictures
  with these options`. `float_ssim_sycl` now applies `float_ssim`'s automatic
  (or explicit, `scale=2..10`) decimation on the device, with planes identical
  to the CPU's bit for bit, and uploads raw samples instead of converting both
  planes to fp32 on the host. At 3840x2160 8-bit on an Arc B580 it takes 6.7 ms
  per frame, against 11.0 ms for the CPU extractor on 16 threads and 29.3 ms
  for the old fallback at the default thread count; scale 1 at 4K drops from
  10.6 to 7.8 ms. `enable_lcs`, `enable_db` and `clip_db` work at every scale.
  Only a plane that decimates below 11x11 still falls back. See
  [the SYCL backend guide](docs/backends/sycl/overview.md#float_ssim-decimation-on-the-device-2026-09-29).
