- A published release's container images can be recovered after a build
  recipe fix (ADR-1347). A `workflow_dispatch` of the image publish workflows
  on the default branch builds the release tag's source with that commit's
  `docker/` recipe and labels each image with `io.vmafx.build-recipe`; the
  dispatch path also reads the prerelease flag from the release itself, so it
  works for release candidates.
