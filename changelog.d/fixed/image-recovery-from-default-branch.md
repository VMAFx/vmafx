- A published release's container images can be recovered after a build
  recipe fix (ADR-1347). A `workflow_dispatch` of the image publish workflows
  on the default branch builds the release tag's source with that commit's
  `docker/` recipe and labels each image with `io.vmafx.build-recipe`; the
  dispatch path also reads the prerelease flag from the release itself, so it
  works for release candidates.
  The release guide now covers the `release-publish` environment step a
  recovery run needs (the environment admits only `v*` tags, so `master` is
  allowed for the recovery and removed afterwards) and how to make a new GHCR
  package public, which the REST API cannot do.
