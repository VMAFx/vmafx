- **Whole-tree clang-tidy ratchet ignores generated build products**: `tidy-ratchet.py`
  now skips every translation unit, diagnostic and header under `--build-dir`, so a
  build directory inside the repository measures the same checked-in sources as one
  outside it. The nightly `Full clang-tidy scan` builds in `build/` and had been failing
  on the 18 `xxd`-generated model embeds (`build/src/*.json.c`,
  `build/src/brisque_live.model.c`, two `misc-use-internal-linkage` warnings each)
  that the cpu baseline no longer lists. `make tidy-ratchet` / `tidy-ratchet-write` with
  the default in-tree `core/build` no longer measure or record them either. The arm64
  baseline, recorded from an in-tree `build-arm64`, was re-measured on its own toolchain:
  764 to 615 warnings (36 generated-file warnings, 25 already-ignored Pelorus-mirror
  entries and 88 warnings cleaned since 2026-09-23; no count rose) (ADR-1142).
