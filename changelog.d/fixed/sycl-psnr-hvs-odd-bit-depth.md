- **SYCL: `psnr_hvs_sycl` scores 9- and 11-bit input like the CPU.** The twin
  multiplied 9- and 11-bit samples by 16 before scoring them, so through the C
  API a 9-bit clip that the CPU scored at 22.47 dB came out at -1.57 dB
  (11 bits: 33.97 against 10.43). It now reads the raw sample at every bit
  depth, as `psnr_hvs` does; 8-, 10- and 12-bit scores are unchanged. The CLI
  accepts only 8, 10, 12 and 16 bits (`T-SYCL-PSNR-HVS-ODD-BPC-SCALE-2026-09-29`).
