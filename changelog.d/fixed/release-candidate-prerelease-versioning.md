- Release candidates after `1.0.0-rc.1` are numbered `1.0.0-rc.2`,
  `1.0.0-rc.3`, and so on (ADR-1348). release-please used its default
  versioning, which turned the first fix after `1.0.0-rc.1` into a proposed
  `1.0.1-rc.1` (release PR #1575); it now uses `prerelease` versioning, and the
  final cut becomes `1.0.0` once `prerelease` is switched off. The release guide
  also no longer claims that every new GHCR package starts private: with the
  organization's public-package setting on, a package first pushed from this
  repository is created public.
