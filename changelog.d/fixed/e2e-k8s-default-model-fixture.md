- **Nightly Kubernetes E2E scores again** — the kind + kuttl scoring smoke sent
  a 64x64 clip to `/v1/score`. Since `vmaf_v1.0.16_3d0h` became the default
  model (ADR-1169), libvmaf refuses input that small (`cambi` needs one side of
  at least 216 pixels, `speed_chroma` needs 4:2:0 luma of at least 160x160), so
  the server answered HTTP 500 and every scheduled E2E run from 2026-09-24 on
  failed. The fixtures are now 216x160, the smallest size the default model
  accepts, and the test ConfigMap is created with server-side apply because the
  larger pair exceeds the 256 KiB annotation that client-side apply writes. The
  always-on E2E contract test now checks the fixture size against the
  thresholds in `core/src/feature/` on every pull request. On failure the score
  script now prints the `/v1/score` error body and the server Pods' logs; it
  previously discarded the body and, through `deployment/vmafx`, printed the
  operator's logs instead.
