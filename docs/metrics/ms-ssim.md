# MS-SSIM

MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index Measure) extends SSIM to a
multi-resolution pyramid, providing a perceptual similarity metric that is
robust to viewing distance and display resolution variation. Each scale
captures structural information at a different spatial frequency. The score is
in `[0, 1]`, higher is better, and `1.0` means identical frames.

The fork ships one CPU extractor, `float_ms_ssim`. It uses the IQA library's
Gaussian-window floating-point implementation with a 5-scale Laplacian pyramid
(Wang et al. 2004), and it is the extractor invoked when VMAF model JSON files
reference `"float_ms_ssim"`. The CLI also accepts `integer_ms_ssim` as an alias
for it.

## How to run

```bash
# Luma-only MS-SSIM (default)
build/tools/vmaf \
    --reference ref.yuv --distorted dist.yuv \
    --width 1920 --height 1080 --pixel_format 420 --bitdepth 8 \
    --no_prediction --feature float_ms_ssim --output /dev/stdout

# Per-channel MS-SSIM (luma + Cb + Cr)
build/tools/vmaf \
    --reference ref.yuv --distorted dist.yuv \
    --width 1920 --height 1080 --pixel_format 420 --bitdepth 8 \
    --no_prediction --feature float_ms_ssim=enable_chroma=true --output /dev/stdout
```

The minimum supported input resolution is 176x176 (see
[Minimum resolution](#minimum-resolution)).

## Output features

| Feature name | Description | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `float_ms_ssim` | MS-SSIM on the luma (Y) plane | Always |
| `float_ms_ssim_cb` | MS-SSIM on the Cb (U) chroma plane | `enable_chroma=true` only |
| `float_ms_ssim_cr` | MS-SSIM on the Cr (V) chroma plane | `enable_chroma=true` only |
| `float_ms_ssim_l_scale0-4` | Per-scale luminance component | `enable_lcs=true`, luma only |
| `float_ms_ssim_c_scale0-4` | Per-scale contrast component | `enable_lcs=true`, luma only |
| `float_ms_ssim_s_scale0-4` | Per-scale structure component | `enable_lcs=true`, luma only |

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_chroma` | bool | `false` | Emit per-plane `_cb` and `_cr` scores in addition to luma. YUV400P sources are always luma-only. |
| `enable_lcs` | bool | `false` | Emit per-scale luminance, contrast, and structure intermediate components for the luma plane. |
| `enable_db` | bool | `false` | Report the luma MS-SSIM score as dB (`-10 * log10(1 - score)`). |
| `clip_db` | bool | `false` | Cap the dB score at a ceiling derived from the frame geometry. Only meaningful when `enable_db=true`. |

`clip_db` sets `max_db = ceil(10 * log10(peak² / mse))` with
`mse = 0.5 / (w * h)`. It is a ceiling on the dB *output*, not a clamp on the
linear score, and it also defines what a perfect match reports: `score >= 1.0`
returns `max_db` rather than `+Inf`.

!!! warning "GPU `clip_db` scores before ADR-1221 were wrong"
    Up to and including v3.2.1 the CUDA, SYCL and HIP twins read `clip_db` as
    a clamp on the *linear* score (`[0, 1]`, then `-10 * log10(1 - score)`
    with no ceiling) and carried no `max_db` at all. Scoring an identical
    reference/distorted pair returned `+Inf`, and every high-similarity pair
    returned an uncapped dB value, so `clip_db` did not clip. Fixed per
    [ADR-1221](../adr/1221-gpu-ms-ssim-db-ceiling.md). Re-measure any GPU
    MS-SSIM dB score taken with `clip_db` set. The Metal twin has been brought
    to full parity by [ADR-1334](../adr/1334-metal-ms-ssim-option-parity.md),
    implementing `enable_db`, `clip_db` with `max_db` ceiling, and
    `enable_chroma`.

## Minimum resolution

The 5-level 11-tap pyramid needs every scored plane to be at least 176x176.
Smaller inputs fall below the 11-tap Gaussian kernel footprint and are
rejected with an error at init time (Netflix#1414 /
[ADR-0153](../adr/0153-float-ms-ssim-min-dim-netflix-1414.md)).

With `enable_chroma` the rule includes the subsampled planes:

- **4:2:0.** Plane allocation uses ceil subsampling, so the exact luma minimum
  is 351x351 (352x352 is the next even-sized input), not 176x176.
- **4:2:2.** The luma minimum is 351x176.
- **YUV400P.** There is no chroma: the option is ignored and luma is scored.
- **Too small.** The CPU extractor and every twin refuse an input whose scored
  plane is smaller, at init, and name the chroma size they measured. A run on
  this repository's 576x324 4:2:0 Netflix fixture (288x162 chroma) with
  `enable_chroma` therefore writes no scores on any backend.

Before ADR-1299 the CPU extractor checked luma only, and a 4:2:0 input in
between died mid-run with `error: scale below 1x1!` on stdout and no output
file.

## GPU twins

Every GPU twin takes the CPU extractor's four options and computes what they
ask for on the device (read from each twin's own `options[]` table):

| Twin | Backend | `enable_lcs` | `enable_db` | `clip_db` | `enable_chroma` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `float_ms_ssim_cuda` | CUDA | yes | yes | yes | yes, computed on the GPU (3 planes), since 2026-10-03 |
| `float_ms_ssim_sycl` | SYCL | yes | yes | yes | yes, computed on the GPU (3 planes) |
| `integer_ms_ssim_hip` | HIP | yes | yes | yes | yes, computed on the GPU (3 planes), since 2026-10-03 |
| `float_ms_ssim_metal` | Metal | yes | yes | yes | yes, computed on the GPU (3 planes) |

With `enable_chroma=true` each twin gives every scored plane its own
geometry, pyramid and score storage, runs the luma pipeline on it and writes
`float_ms_ssim_cb` and `float_ms_ssim_cr`. Every twin lists both among the
features it provides, so a model that asks for them is served on the GPU. The
SYCL twin got the option with
[ADR-1299](../adr/1299-sycl-ms-ssim-chroma-implementation.md) and the Metal
twin with [ADR-1334](../adr/1334-metal-ms-ssim-option-parity.md).

!!! warning "HIP runs with `enable_chroma` before 2026-10-03 have no chroma scores"
    `integer_ms_ssim_hip` accepted the option, scored luma only and wrote
    neither `float_ms_ssim_cb` nor `float_ms_ssim_cr`, without a warning. The
    CUDA twin had no such option, so the same request ran the CPU extractor
    and its scores were right. Re-run any HIP measurement that needs the
    chroma scores.

### Selecting the twin from the command line

`--backend cuda`, `--backend sycl` or `--backend hip` with
`--feature float_ms_ssim=enable_chroma=true` runs that backend's twin (the
JSON output's `feature_backends` names it); `--backend cpu` runs the CPU
extractor. A model that names the features reaches the twin the same way. The
Vulkan backend was removed in ADR-0726.

```bash
vmaf --reference ref.yuv --distorted dist.yuv \
     --width 1920 --height 1080 --pixel_format 420 --bitdepth 8 \
     --backend cuda --feature float_ms_ssim=enable_chroma=true \
     --no_prediction --json --output ms_ssim.json --precision max
```

### Agreement with the CPU

| Twin | vs CPU | ADR | Evidence (fragments in `scripts/ci/exact_twins.d/`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `float_ms_ssim_cuda` | Exact | [ADR-1403](../adr/1403-cuda-strict-fp-every-kernel.md), ADR-1465 | `float_ms_ssim.cuda`, `float_ms_ssim_lcs.cuda`, `float_ms_ssim_chroma.cuda` |
| `float_ms_ssim_sycl` | Exact | [ADR-1414](../adr/1414-sycl-float-ms-ssim-cpu-arithmetic.md), [ADR-1466](../adr/1466-sycl-float-ms-ssim-raster-sum.md) | `float_ms_ssim.sycl`, `float_ms_ssim_lcs.sycl`, `float_ms_ssim_chroma.sycl` |
| `integer_ms_ssim_hip` | Exact | ADR-1403, ADR-1437, ADR-1438 | `float_ms_ssim.hip`, `float_ms_ssim_lcs.hip`, `float_ms_ssim_chroma.hip` |
| `float_ms_ssim_metal` | Tolerance 5e-5 (`FEATURE_TOLERANCE`); still uses the old arithmetic | none | none |

All three exact twins reproduce the CPU's arithmetic and add every
per-scale sum in the CPU's order. The cost of that, in milliseconds per frame
(CPU extractor on the same host for reference):

| Twin | Resolution | Time per frame | Before |
|---|---|---|---|
| SYCL (Arc A380, ADR-1414) | 3840x2160 | 42.6 ms | 31.4 ms |
| SYCL (Arc A380, ADR-1414) | 576x324 | 0.84 to 1.20 ms | not recorded |
| SYCL (Arc A380, ADR-1466) | 3840x2160 | 75.9 ms | 44.7 ms |
| SYCL (Arc A380, ADR-1466) | 1920x1080 | 18.2 ms | 11.5 ms |
| SYCL (Arc A380, ADR-1466) | 576x324 | 1.92 ms | 1.16 ms |
| CPU extractor | 3840x2160, same host | 117 ms | |

The ADR-1466 SYCL twin also needs 219 MB of device and pinned host memory at
3840x2160 ([SYCL
backend](../backends/sycl/overview.md#float_ms_ssim_sycl-adds-its-per-scale-sums-in-the-cpus-order-2026-10-02)).

#### How the CUDA and SYCL twins compute it

- The decimate fuses each tap as `ms_ssim_decimate.c` does.
- The Gaussian window sums are fp32 products added as the CPU's `double` sum
  is.
- The luminance, contrast and structure terms use the CPU's operand types.
- The CUDA twin does this in `double`. The SYCL twin, which may not use
  `double` on the device, carries those values as exact pairs of floats and
  adds the frame sums in 64-bit fixed point.

#### Measured agreement of `float_ms_ssim_sycl` (ADR-1414)

Arc A380, `--precision max` against `--backend cpu`, frames identical and the
largest difference:

| Fixture | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Netflix 576x324, 48 frames | 0 of 48, 6.9e-8 | 48 of 48 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 1 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 1.06e-6 | 3 of 3 |
| Checkerboard 1920x1080, 10 px shift, 3 frames | 0 of 3, 2.98e-6 | 3 of 3 |
| BBB 3840x2160 | 0 of 50, 1.23e-6 | 199 of 200, 1.1e-16 |

With `enable_lcs` all 15 per-scale means are the CPU's on every frame (50 BBB
frames), and so are `float_ms_ssim_cb` / `float_ms_ssim_cr` with
`enable_chroma`, and the score at 10, 12 and 16 bits.

The reference in this table is a GCC build. The one BBB frame that differs
does so in the last bit of the `double`: the twin's host combine calls the
`pow()` of its own Intel-compiler build. Against the CPU extractor of its own
binary the twin is identical on every frame. With `enable_db` the same holds
for `log10()` (3.6e-15 on 3 of 48 Netflix frames against a GCC build).

#### Exact by construction (ADR-1466)

The match after ADR-1414 was exact in practice, not by construction. The CPU
adds each frame's terms into a running `double` and the twins added them in
another order. The rounding of each per-scale mean to `float` absorbs the
difference unless the mean sits next to a rounding boundary.

Such frames exist (`T-GPU-FLOAT-SSIM-FRAME-SUM-ORDER-2026-10-02`). On a
176x176 noise pair `float_ms_ssim_sycl` returned 0.9884905219078064 for
`float_ms_ssim_l_scale0` where the CPU returns 0.9884904623031616, one `float`
step.

Since 2026-10-02 the SYCL twin stores every window's `l`, `c` and `s` of every
scale, with `l` and `c` as the CPU's `double` values, and adds them on the host
in the CPU's order. It returns the CPU's value on that pair. Against a GCC
build of the CPU extractor on an Arc A380: `float_ms_ssim` on 138 of 138
frames and 2208 of 2208 `enable_lcs` values.

### The chroma planes

With `enable_chroma` the twins run the same kernels and host sums on each
chroma plane, so the chroma scores are exact for the same reasons the luma
score is. Measured on 2026-10-03 at `--precision max` against the CPU
extractor of a GCC build, with each option set (`enable_chroma` alone, with
`enable_lcs`, with `enable_db`, with `enable_db` and `clip_db`):

| Fixture | Frames | CUDA (RTX 4090) | HIP (gfx1036) |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Checkerboard 1920x1080 4:2:0, 1 px and 10 px shift | 3 + 3 | identical | identical |
| Netflix 576x324 4:2:2 10-bit | 48 | identical | identical |
| Netflix 576x324 4:4:4, 8 and 10 bit | 48 + 48 | identical | identical |
| Netflix 576x324 4:4:4, reference against itself | 48 | identical | identical |
| BBB 1920x1080 4:4:4 | 24 | identical | identical |
| BBB 3840x2160 4:2:0 | 30 | identical | identical |
| Netflix 576x324 4:2:0 (288x162 chroma) | 48 | refused, as the CPU | refused, as the CPU |

That is 6 804 of 6 804 values on each of CUDA and HIP, the `feature_backends`
of every run naming the twin.

- **SYCL.** The twin (Arc A380, build of `master` 9aa990455) returns the CPU
  extractor of its own binary on the same runs, 5 508 of 5 508 values. Against
  the GCC build 52 of 6 804 values differ by at most 2.1e-14, all from the
  Intel math library's `pow()` and `log10()` in its host combine.
- **Parity gate.** The `float_ms_ssim_chroma` cell compares the three scores
  with tolerance 0 on CUDA, SYCL and HIP. On a fixture whose chroma is below
  176 pixels it is reported `SKIP` with the reason.

The chroma planes cost what their area costs: a 4:2:0 frame scores 1.5 times
the luma area, a 4:4:4 frame 3 times. Milliseconds per frame,
(t(N) - t(2)) / (N - 2) through the `vmaf` tool, median of 3:

| Input | CUDA luma | CUDA with chroma | HIP luma | HIP with chroma |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BBB 3840x2160 4:2:0, N = 42 | 33.0 | 46.5 | 186.7 | 257.8 |
| BBB 1920x1080 4:4:4, N = 24 | 9.7 | 22.6 | 39.1 | 119.2 |

Device and pinned host memory grow by the same factor: every plane keeps its
own pyramid and per-window terms.

## History

- **2026-10-03.** CUDA and HIP twins compute `enable_chroma` on the device
  (HIP before this date scored luma only; see the warning above).
- **2026-10-02, ADR-1466.** The SYCL twin adds every per-scale sum in the
  CPU's raster order; it is exact by construction.
- **ADR-1414.** The SYCL twin computes the CPU's arithmetic in exact float
  pairs. The HIP twin computes the CPU's arithmetic as well (ADR-1403).
- **ADR-1221.** GPU `clip_db` became a ceiling on the dB output (see the
  warning under [Options](#options)).
- **ADR-1299.** The SYCL twin gained `enable_chroma` and the CPU extractor
  checks every scored plane against the minimum size.
