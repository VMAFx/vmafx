/*
 * The Metal side of the shared twin-parity headers, and the case runner of
 * the Metal parity tests (ADR-1496).
 *
 * The shared headers (float_psnr_twin_parity.h, ssim_twin_parity.h, ...) take
 * a backend as three callbacks; metal_twin_open(), metal_twin_import() and
 * metal_twin_close() are Metal's. A missing device makes open() fail, the
 * case reports the skip and the run exits 77.
 *
 * The macOS tester bundle runs these executables on the tester's Mac and
 * reads one line per case from their standard error:
 *
 *     @case <case function> pass|fail|skip
 *
 * (tools/rc1-tester/src/vmaf_rc1_tester/hw_suites.py). metal_run_case() runs
 * a case, prints that line and keeps going after a failure, so one run gives
 * the verdict of every case and the report can say which state rows it
 * measures; the run still fails with the first failure's message.
 *
 * Self-test: built with VMAF_METAL_TWIN_SELFTEST, METAL_TWIN() names the CPU
 * extractor, open() hands out a placeholder state and import() does nothing,
 * so every case compares the CPU extractor with itself on any host. A case
 * whose `==` fails there has a fixture or a key wrong, not a twin; a case that
 * only means something on a device (a twin's own refusal of a frame size)
 * returns early under metal_twin_device_only().
