# Research-digest identifier ratchet

`check-research-digest-ids.py` scans every `docs/research/NNNN-*.md`
digest except `0000` template. New digests must have unique numeric
prefix and first H1 beginning `# Research-NNNN`, with same number as
filename. generated `research-digest-id-baseline.json` records exact
pre-existing collision sets and exact non-canonical H1 text; those entries are
debt, not exceptions to copy. ADR-1335 binds every audit to trusted merge
base: branch baseline must exactly match its tree and may only reduce
trusted debt. Ordinary `--write` requires canonical baseline at that merge
base. separate `--bootstrap-from-ref` path accepts only full immutable
ancestor that predates checker and baseline, refuses overwrite and debt growth,
and must never appear in CI or hook commands. Preserve live trusted-ref
gate, deterministic writer, planted deletion/rewrite/growth red caps, both
local hooks, and Rule Enforcement invocation together.
