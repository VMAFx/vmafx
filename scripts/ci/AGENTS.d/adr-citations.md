# Source ADR citation provenance (ADR-1311, ADR-2200)

`check-source-adr-citations.py` owns plain `ADR-NNNN` references in tracked
implementation and build/control files. Preserve the explicit source-suffix /
basename scope, the derived `number -> filename -> path/count` bindings, the
hand-governed retirement records, the exact-path fixture exemptions, the
always-run pre-commit hook, and the positive/negative/boundary test suite
together.

Live bindings are derived from `git ls-files` and `docs/adr/` on every run
(ADR-2200). They are not recorded: a change that cites an ADR edits no shared
file. `source-adr-citations.json` is schema 2 and holds only `retired` and
`fixtures`; a `live` key is an error, and there is no `--write`. Keep the
refusals: a number with no ADR file and no retirement record; a retired number
that has an ADR file again; a fixture number cited outside its recorded paths
or with other counts. Never auto-invent a retirement, broaden a fixture
exemption, or accept a reused retired number. Markdown links remain the
separate `check-adr-links.py` contract. `mkdocs.yml` is prose navigation, not
source, and stays outside this gate so its full ADR index cannot masquerade as
1,000+ implementation citations.
Disposable test repositories must strip every inherited `GIT_*` variable,
disable caller system/global configuration, hooks, and signing for both direct
Git calls and checker subprocesses. The regression poisons `GIT_INDEX_FILE`,
`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, and `GIT_PREFIX` and byte-checks the caller index
and repository configuration; do not weaken it to a clean-shell-only test.
