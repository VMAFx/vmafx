# Dev-container GitHub build secret (ADR-1271)

`check-dev-container-build-secret.py` binds these surfaces: optional
`github_token` mount in `dev/Containerfile`, its Compose environment source,
stage builder `build-dev-container-stage.sh <target> <tag>` (ADR-1346), its
workflow callers, GHCR publisher's secret, NEO fetcher's rate-limit
remedy, and anonymous/authenticated operator examples. Secret consumers
derived from stage graph (FROM parent + `COPY --from`, via
`check-container-image-references.py` parser): `build-deps` and
`release-build` consume nothing; `gpu-sdks` and every stage built on it
consume. Builder allowlists targets in `case` (`release-build`,
`libvmaf-build`; `build-deps` dropped by ADR-1354, no caller) and forwards
`--secret` exactly for consuming targets; callers set `GITHUB_TOKEN` on
step exactly for consuming targets, never job- or workflow-wide. Callers:
`dev-container-build.yml` (`libvmaf-build` gate + `release-build` release
rehearsal), `supply-chain.yml` `build-artifacts` (`release-build`). Never
replace secret with `ARG` or `ENV`, make it required, or expose it to
runtime service. Real invariant on raw builds: in those two workflows
every `docker build` is either `--check` (lint, builds no image; gate
runs `docker build --check --target libvmaf-build`) or goes through
builder; `dev-container-publish.yml` is one other workflow build of
`dev/Containerfile` (build-push-action to GHCR, off release path, own
`secrets:` check). Builder stays free of `--cache-from`/`--cache-to` and
`--build-arg`: release must not restore layers another run wrote.
`tests/test_dev_container_build_secret.py` mutation-checks those failure
modes, runs real builder against stub `docker`, and is wired to
pre-commit/pre-push; Dev Container workflow additionally runs native
Docker and Compose `--check` before building.
