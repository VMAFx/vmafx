# Drop fixtures that a previous download left in an unusable state, so the
# lazy fetcher re-downloads them instead of trusting them.
#
# compat/python-vmaf/config.py::download_reactively fetches a fixture only when
# the local file is ABSENT. A file that exists but is empty, or that holds an
# HTTP error page or a Git-LFS pointer instead of the payload, is therefore
# never repaired: it is "present", so the download is skipped, and the test
# fails with something unhelpful like `no frames decoded`. When such a file is
# captured into the CI fixture cache, every later run on that branch restores
# it and fails the same way until someone deletes the cache by hand.
#
# The success()-gated cache save stops NEW poisoning; this prunes what is
# already out there. Deleting a fixture is always safe — the worst case is one
# extra download.
#
# The cache also holds the files of ROOT that git tracks, in the revision of
# the run that saved it, and actions/cache/restore writes them over the
# checkout. A restore-keys hit (any run whose test files differ) therefore
# brings back the old revision of a tracked fixture a later commit changed,
# and the tests read it instead of the commit's: a dataset file without the
# fields its test asserts, and the run fails, so the success()-gated save of
# a fresh key never happens either. After pruning, every tracked file under
# ROOT is put back to the checked-out revision; untracked downloads stay.
#
# Usage: prune-corrupt-fixtures.sh [--restore-tracked] [ROOT]
#        (default ROOT: python/test/resource; the CI workflows pass
#        --restore-tracked right after restoring the fixture cache)
