# framework-hooks.sh — hand one lefthook stage to the pre-commit framework
# (ADR-1249). lefthook.yml calls this file from a one-line `run:`.
#
# Why a file and not an inline `run: |` block: on Windows, lefthook v2.1.14
# starts `sh -c` through a hand-built command line and does not escape the
# script (internal/run/controller/exec/exec_windows.go builds
# `"<sh>" -c "<run>"`). The first double quote inside the script therefore
# ends the `-c` argument. The inline block failed with "unexpected end of file
# from `if' command", and a one-line command silently lost every word after
# its first quoted string. Keep double quotes out of every lefthook `run:`
# value; scripts/githooks/tests/test_install.py enforces that.
#
# Usage: framework-hooks.sh pre-commit
#        framework-hooks.sh pre-push REMOTE URL   (push refs on stdin)
